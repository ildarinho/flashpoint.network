Sup, buddy.

In summary, preparing for the JNCIE-SP track took 450 hours. I tried to hold 16 hours rate per week. I start to learn track with self-study bundle and also read network books like a "Day one" or "MPLS in SDN era", network articles and juniper documentation.

It took me several attempts to pass the JNCIE-SP JPR-961 exam. My finally pass attempt was in July 2023. I received #3168.  What about some tips for you, read cool articles from this awesome people https://next-hopself.net/First-Blog-Post/ and https://www.networkfuntimes.com/my-jncie-sp-exam-experience/. Here you go my tips for you about the lab:
Any issue can be a cause of panic or stress, so think in advance about how you will handle it.
Self-study bundle are very useful and constitute an important part of the preparation, but do not cover 100% of the JPR-961 exam.
Read the introduction part of the JPR-961 exam carefully, as it may contain key points.
If everything goes well in the lab, that's great. Otherwise, think in advance about what things to focus on to make your next attempt successful.
 Of course JNCIE-SP lab was brutal, exhausting and painful. And - it was well worth it.
